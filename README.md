- 👋 Hello, I’m @Calternarr
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, video game development and computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Luau as a first language, learning it along the way and interested in languages ​​like Python and C++, also learning C# alongside Luau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, projects and trying to get paid and work off of this, while having fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: calternar.contact@gmail.com / o_9clt dc.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been involved in computing since I was 8 years old, but at the time I didn't know anything about publishing what I do until I was 14 years old.
